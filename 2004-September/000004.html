</I>
Having a command for that is ok, but I really think such a list box  
listing online users is very important, because:
1) when people think &quot;chat&quot;, people think about the traditional &quot;mIRC&quot;  
chat layout, with an input box, messages scrolling up, and a listbox where  
they can easily see who's online
2) listing people on this listbox with their respective color is handy, as  
it will become annoying to type a /fooBar command whenever you want to  
remember who is the user with color &quot;red&quot;

&gt;<i> Cool, name ? url ?  msn ? (asktav did not get google results)

yeah, I also don't know his realname. I'll have a lot of free time from  
friday till wednesday, so I'll devote more time to chalks and hang around  
IRC to see what tav has to say.

&gt;<i> I will try to get some time in between here to december (asap) to solve  
</I>&gt;<i> dummy issues in the code. (as for example the actual error in the

</I>
Cool :)

&gt;<i> I would like we agree in the desired behaviour when someone disconnect  
</I>&gt;<i> himself (in the topology topic), this is the only point missing to get a  
</I>&gt;<i> smooth cool global design.
</I>
He doesn't need to warn his children before disconnecting, mostly because  
sometimes he can't predict when he's going to disconnect (unpredictable  
networking problems).

What needs to happen is that once a new children connects to him, he  
should tell this children about his parent, so the children has a backup  
server to connect to once it realizes it's parent has died.

I don't think there are any outstanding synchronization issues specific to  
this &quot;parent disconnection&quot; event. Such dissynchronizations are probably  
common and our concurrent editing engine should overcome them naturally.  
It doesn't matter if they were cause by a parent disconnection and the  
fact you now have a new parent or a simple network lag. In whichever case,  
it should always try to be in sync, by requesting a batch of all  
operations up to it's current version, in order to bring it's text to the  
latest version, update it's HB, etc.


See you,
