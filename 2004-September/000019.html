I understood the problem and agree with your solution of using a unique  
ChalksAvatar interface, but I'm not sure if PB will allow us to manipulate  
Avatars this easily and send them over the wire. If that works as planned,  
then we're done, since the implementation seems to be a lot cleaner than  
the alternative way I propose after this paragraph. In other words, only  
read the rest of this message if the unique ChalksAvatar interface  
approach doesn't work and we have to rethink the whole system:

There is one server, with several clients. Each client (children) has  
exactly one parent, right ?
So the server has to know which of its children called a remote method,  
but a client doesn't need that: it has only one parent and thus all remote  
calls are obviously from his parent server.

Before joining Chalks, I thought about this issue and how it should be  
properly done with Twisted's PB, and it all became clear to me with the  
following example, which is very simple and even does more than we need,  
since this example would allow a server to serve multiple files and keep  
track of which client is contributing to which file: (The complete source  
is available at /twisted/doc/core/howto/listings/pb/chat{client,server}.py)

The example uses 3 PB concepts: Perspectives, plain Referenceables and  
Views.

The SERVER is made of the following 4 classes:

class ChatServer:
     def __init__(self):
         self.groups = {} # indexed by name

     def joinGroup(self, groupname, user, allowMattress):
         if not self.groups.has_key(groupname):
             self.groups[groupname] = Group(groupname, allowMattress)
         self.groups[groupname].addUser(user)
         return self.groups[groupname]

class ChatRealm:
     __implements__ = portal.IRealm
     def requestAvatar(self, avatarID, mind, *interfaces):
         assert pb.IPerspective in interfaces
         avatar = User(avatarID)
         avatar.server = self.server
         avatar.attached(mind)
         return pb.IPerspective, avatar, lambda a=avatar:a.detached(mind)

class User(pb.Avatar):
     def __init__(self, name):
         self.name = name
     def attached(self, mind):
         self.remote = mind
     def detached(self, mind):
         self.remote = None
     def perspective_joinGroup(self, groupname, allowMattress=True):
         return self.server.joinGroup(groupname, self, allowMattress)
     def send(self, message):
         self.remote.callRemote(&quot;print&quot;, message)

class Group(pb.Viewable):
     def __init__(self, groupname, allowMattress):
         self.name = groupname
         self.allowMattress = allowMattress
         self.users = []
     def addUser(self, user):
         self.users.append(user)
     def view_send(self, from_user, message):
         if not self.allowMattress and message.find(&quot;mattress&quot;) != -1:
             raise ValueError, &quot;Don't say that word&quot;
         for user in self.users:
             user.send(&quot;&lt;%s&gt; says: %s&quot; % (from_user.name, message))

The Group class would be our EditableFile, where clients invoke methods  
like view_sendMessage and view_sendOperation. The from_user parameter on  
each of these view_* methods is a User instance. Each User instance has a  
&quot;remote&quot; attribute, where you can do stuff like  
from_user.remote.callRemote(&quot;propagateOperation&quot;, opData).

Since we serve only one file, the ChatServer class is dispensable, as we  
would only have one instance of Group.

On the User class, we would have administrative remote methods, like  
perspective_joinGroup(), which would become perspective_collaborateIn().  
All this method would do is return a Group() instance.

The ChatRealm class would need no changes.

Now, on the CLIENT side, we have only one class:

class Client(pb.Referenceable):

     def remote_print(self, message):
         print message

     def connect(self):
         factory = pb.PBClientFactory()
         reactor.connectTCP(&quot;localhost&quot;, 8800, factory)
         def1 = factory.login(credentials.UsernamePassword(&quot;alice&quot;, &quot;1234&quot;),
                              client=self)
         def1.addCallback(self.connected)
         reactor.run()

     def connected(self, perspective):
         print &quot;connected, joining group #lookingForFourth&quot;
         # this perspective is a reference to our User object
         d = perspective.callRemote(&quot;joinGroup&quot;, &quot;#lookingForFourth&quot;)
         d.addCallback(self.gotGroup)

     def gotGroup(self, group):
         print &quot;joined group, now sending a message to all members&quot;
         # 'group' is a reference to the Group object (through a ViewPoint)
         d = group.callRemote(&quot;send&quot;, &quot;You can call me Al.&quot;)
         d.addCallback(self.shutdown)

     def shutdown(self, result):
         reactor.stop()


Once connected, the client receives a perspective (our User() avatar),  
where it would call perspective_collaborateIn().
The server would respond a collaborateIn() call with a Viewable instance  
(the Group() instance on the server). The client would use this view to  
call remote file methods like &quot;sendMessage&quot;, &quot;sendOperation&quot;.

The ugly part is that this Client class would need to forward some calls  
(like chat messages and operations) to all users of the Group class, but  
that would be as simple as:

for user in myGroup.users:
      user.remote.callRemote(&quot;sendMessage&quot;, messageData)
