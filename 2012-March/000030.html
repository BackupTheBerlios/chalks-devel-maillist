<PRE>done at the implementation of the implementation of the Gui and the
ConcurrentEditableWidget.

The design does not specify how each layer achieve his purpose, just
what method and abstraction it have to provide.

In particular the Network layer can use any protocol, and possibly it
will change in the time. The actual implementation use a dumb
serialization schema, and thus I see it very difficult to make it
compatible with another non .Net implementation without reimplementing
a considerable part of the .Net Remoting layer.

Also I see non sense in implementing multiple ConcurrentEdition
systems, which is (in theory) the most delicate aspect of the software
(the more complex and the more difficult to debug).

I do not know how is implemented MateEdit, but I think we have similar
purpose. So I invite you to share ideas, keep in touch, and if
motivated, participate in the development with ideas, critics, bugs
report, or better, coding !

For Kde/Gnome integration I repeat that, at first view,  the best
choice would be to do a Kde based implementation of the
ConcurrentEditionWidget and the Gui, and reuse directly the two lower
level layers. I can comment that both of them are pretty simple. I
implemented them alone, as part time (1 hour per day, app), in three
weeks, and it was my first time (yes I swear) with .Net And with Gtk.

That is all by now, I will be waiting news from you. A Kde/Gnome
integration will without doubt boost the project, that, as you know,
is already a very solicited one.
