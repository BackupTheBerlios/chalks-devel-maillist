<PRE>Hi folks,
work is going on, and there is one thing I still not viewing clear:
does the gui is fine or not ?

Kesava has not retrofitted us since his subscription on the
openusability project. this is not a  good sign (kesava, are you there
?).

This topic touch various elements of the todo list so I would like to
solve them as soon as possible.

5  - Interface and interactions design validation
6  - Preferences dialog (what we want to make customizable ?)
8  - Implement password user interface
10 - ConcurrentEditableWidget tooltips

Essentially I have two questions whose answer is not clear to me:
A) Which things should we let the user configure ?
B) How we should associate the colors in the text to the users ?

My answer for question A) is : &quot;Nothing&quot;.
Ultra simple programs does not need preferences.  If user lack of
something, we should make it autoconfigured.

Question B) is more difficult, I see three options:
a) Coloring consistently the messages received is enough
b) The user type the command \who to get an up-to-date list of the
users, each name colored consistently
c) There is always a section of the window that show a colored users
list (this one I want to avoid it, knowing users colors is a not
highly relevant for the user, however is the way Subethadedit and
MoonEdit does it)
d) When putting the mouse over colored text a popup appears to
indicate the originator name's
e) The user click over the &quot;N users&quot; section of the status bar and a
secondary window appears with the list of the users. The user can
switch from one window to the other to consult the users.

I need opinions on these topic. Ricardo, could you give your votes ?

My opinion is:
a) + b) + d)
(in that order of priority for implementation too)

rodrigob.
