<PRE>Hi Kesava,
we are very pleased to know that an usability expert has joined the
development of Chalks.

As Chalks has as objective to be used in everyday life usable
interface is a core preoccupation. You collaboration is very welcome !


Actually we are working to get the first alpha version operational. As
you could look in the project web page
<A HREF="http://chalks.berlios.de">http://chalks.berlios.de</A>

Chalks is a project that started in 2003 and still going on. We had a
first version in Python and now have switched to .Net, doing a
complete rewrite of the code.

The actual Gui is made using Gtk, but the revised design allow the
implementation of specific guis for each platform if required. For the
first development iteration we will be using the cross platform
capabilities of Gtk.

Actually the Gui is almost structured and now we are working in the
&quot;invisible&quot; layers, so I think you could already take a look and make
you first appreciations. On the technical side I think that the
easiest thing to you is to take a look at the chalks.glade file (using
Glade)  and look the LeoN/Chalks screen shots available on the web
site.


I'm specially worried of two things:

- The specific design of the Gui itself (having the required
preferences, a good order for the menus, the correct information on
the status bar, etc...)

- The design of the interaction of the user with a collaborative
system, in particular when the user joins a session or when a remote
user enter into the document being edited.

I would be very pleased to hear your comments about the actual overall
design, and your opinion about how a concurrent plain text edition
system should look.

Feel free to ask any question about the  project,

Thanks for joining,
rodrigob.
