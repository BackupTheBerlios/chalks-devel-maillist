<PRE>Hi,

&gt;<i> Essentially I have two questions whose answer is not clear to me:
</I>&gt;<i> A) Which things should we let the user configure ?
</I>&gt;<i> B) How we should associate the colors in the text to the users ?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> My answer for question A) is : &quot;Nothing&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> Ultra simple programs does not need preferences.  If user lack of
</I>&gt;<i> something, we should make it autoconfigured.
</I>
I agree with your minimalistic approach to make the software easier to
use and more robust, but I believe there are some important options
that can't be autoconfigured, including:

1) Edit widget font size: some people need larger fonts and some like
a lot of text viewable at once, etc.
2) Choosing whether or not the editor should replace Tabs with spaces
(and how many). Keep in mind that we are working on a pure text
editor, so our target users are those who want to work with pure text
files, and for some of them these aspects are important.

&gt;<i> Question B) is more difficult, I see three options:
</I>&gt;<i> a) Coloring consistently the messages received is enough
</I>&gt;<i> b) The user type the command \who to get an up-to-date list of the
</I>&gt;<i> users, each name colored consistently
</I>
I suggest using &quot;/who&quot; instead of '\who', that is, with a
forward-slash, to be consistent with IRC commands. But I believe these
/xyz commands are only intended for power-users, so for every  /xyz
command, there should be a menu or toolbar option.

These commands would also be very useful for us during debugging.


&gt;<i> c) There is always a section of the window that show a colored users
</I>&gt;<i> list (this one I want to avoid it, knowing users colors is a not
</I>&gt;<i> highly relevant for the user, however is the way Subethadedit and
</I>&gt;<i> MoonEdit does it)
</I>
Yeah, I also agree we could leave that to a second release, but it
would be fine to make this &quot;user list&quot; richer in terms of information.
A good feature would be allowing users to edit a text near their entry
on this user list, describing what they are currently working on or
thinking about. So they don't need to explain what they are doing on
the chat window and you don't have to scroll back the chat window to
find out what user X was thinking about and what he is trying to edit
on the shared text file.

This feature would also be a flexible and simple substitute to &quot;away&quot;
features. So you can change your &quot;user list&quot; extra description from
&quot;reviewing specification section&quot; to something like &quot;away for 5min.&quot;.

&gt;<i> d) When putting the mouse over colored text a popup appears to
</I>&gt;<i> indicate the originator name's
</I>
I guess this is not needed. In most cases, there will be an average of
only 2 concurrent editors, so a simple panel somewhere on the GUI or
as a menu showing which color is which user is fine. The user will
verify it 3 times and after that he will memorize.

&gt;<i> e) The user click over the &quot;N users&quot; section of the status bar and a
</I>&gt;<i> secondary window appears with the list of the users. The user can
</I>&gt;<i> switch from one window to the other to consult the users.
</I>
Even though bringing user info after clicking on this status bar label
seems logical, it may not seem intuitive. I believe we should let the
user list on a very visible place, because people need to constantly
know who's online or not.

Summarizing my opinion:

a) + b) + c)

In this order of implementation.
