</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>I'll try and convert the testcases over the weekend and let you know of 
the results.

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>Convergence is really only an issue for 2 Insert operations on the same

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>start point, which is taken care of by introducing a priority based on
</I>&gt;<i>the client id.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Convergence is an issue because the users generate different
</I>&gt;<i>operations over different text versions, it has nothing to do with
</I>&gt;<i>what you describe. Two operations at the same point at the same
</I>&gt;<i>version relates more (if I remember fine) to intention preservation.
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Maybe I didn't describe it clear enough. Assume Person A types ABC and 
Person B types DEF in the same position concurrently, then you need to 
worry about whether you make that ABCDEF or DEFABC. By convergence only 
being an issue in this case I meant that the intentation preservation 
solves the problem of convergence automatically for all other cases.

&gt;<i>I agree that centralized approaches are much simpler, however we did
</I>&gt;<i>not wanted to use this approach for two reasons:
</I>&gt;<i>- this approach overload the bandwidth of the &quot;server&quot; node.
</I>&gt;<i>- if two groups are collaborating, all the delay will be as slow as
</I>&gt;<i>the server node. In decentralized approach nodes in local area
</I>&gt;<i>networks have the delay of local area network and nodes in remote
</I>&gt;<i>locations have the delay of remote locations. I expect that this
</I>&gt;<i>effect will be noticeable.
</I>&gt;<i>- a decentralized approach allow to use one and only one node as &quot;server&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>OK

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>Fair enough, but again it just might not get used by people using
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>      
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>different languages. (kde libs are usually C++ based for example)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>the dotnet platform can interest people programming in ML, Java, C#,
</I>&gt;<i>Python, we consider that .Net allow better integration and
</I>&gt;<i>collaboration between &quot;people of different languages&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Personally I'm language agnostic, I just try to use the correct tool
</I>&gt;<i>available for the required job.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>The topic is deployability and compatibility, not a C# versus C++ flame ware.
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>This is all fine by me. I don't even want to tell you what tools to use. 
All I'm trying to say is that I don't believe everyone else will take it 
like that.

&gt;<i>Finally, 
</I>&gt;<i>let's imagine that we have a common protocol. And now imagine that I
</I>&gt;<i>need to change something, for example, sites identifier are no more 16
</I>&gt;<i>bytes random numbers, but Ip+Port strings.
</I>&gt;<i>Doing such change would not break immediately the compatibility ?
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Sure changing from a number to a string will be a problem.

&gt;<i>What would have to be done to have systems inter operate again ?
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>We would have to define a new version of the networking protocol 
(protocol version should be checked in the initial connection anyway) 
and maybe try and set up a work around for old clients.

&gt;<i>It will be hard to me to think that specifying a protocol is not
</I>&gt;<i>create double work, double bugs and double pain.
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>I think we are already doing exactly doing that by using 2 different 
approaches.

After looking at your test cases I think the whole thing could be 
problematic anyway. The lack of a globally ordered sequence with your 
approach would seriously upset my approach. Now I am convinced that it 
wouldn't be as easy as defining a protocol, but would also involve 
transferring application states and extending my algorithm. Nevertheless 
it would have been a good thing I believe :)
