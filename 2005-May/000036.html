</I>Having a concurrent editing library does make sense indeed. That's why 
I'll be including the MateEdit core into KDE for every KDE program to 
use. (I only say KDE because I know that people using different toolkits 
would not touch a kde library)

</I>&gt;<i>

</I>Ok let me just show you what I see as necessary for an Insert operation 
and you can tell me what you think needs to be added. Copied verbatim 
from my networking code :)

        stream &lt;&lt; m_type &lt;&lt; m_fromCoords[0] &lt;&lt; m_toCoords[0] &lt;&lt; m_sender 
&lt;&lt; m_state.server &lt;&lt; m_state.client;

            stream &lt;&lt; m_message;

m_type - describes the operation here INSERT
m_fromCoords - starting position
m_toCoords - end position
m_sender - sender id
m_state.server - (always 0 on sending and on closer inspection not 
strictly necessary)
m_state.client - number of messages received from other clients
m_message - the actual text of the insert

&gt;<i>Actually I think that .Net platform is essentially Gui agnostic.
</I>&gt;<i>However we can think in a language agnostic module interconnection
</I>&gt;<i>system to ease the integration with even larger range of applications.
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Just as you already found out not everyone likes .Net or even Mono. The 
danger of the whole thing being shut down, due to some dubious patent or 
license is just to big for some people.

&gt;<i>To enforce the point about the algorithm and the network protocol.
</I>&gt;<i>Supose that I'm implementing an algorithm without garbage collection
</I>&gt;<i>(as MoonEdit probably does)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>You probably meant MateEdit ;)

&gt;<i> then the data to start a session would be:
</I>&gt;<i>state vector, history buffer, text, delayed_operations. If I implement
</I>&gt;<i>garbage collection, then additional information is required,
</I>&gt;<i>minimum_state_vector and state_vector_table. Thus two implementation
</I>&gt;<i>would anyway be incompatible. Of course we are already enforcing one
</I>&gt;<i>kind of history buffer (linear in Chalks case) and the data encoded
</I>&gt;<i>into the operations is also algorithm specific (definition of the
</I>&gt;<i>state_vector, members for the special cases (relative adressing,
</I>&gt;<i>splitted operations, lost information)). So this simple example
</I>&gt;<i>reforce the concept, trying to define a protocol between different
</I>&gt;<i>algorithms is almost impossible. 
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>I am not at all familiar with where the problems are with the &quot;garbage 
collection&quot; algorithm you mention.
In my mind what is needed to start a session is the text and optionally 
a description for each character so a colour and other information can 
be associated. Then you add user data and if you are really keen you can 
retransmit every message that was sent so far to create a history 
buffer, in which case you don't need the text nor the extra character 
information.

&gt;<i>If we are going to fix the algorithm
</I>&gt;<i>to fix the network protocol, then we are loosing flexibility and
</I>&gt;<i>evolvability for both the network layer and the concurrent edition
</I>&gt;<i>layer (that would lead to the apparition of non compatible
</I>&gt;<i>applications anyway). The logic choice is to define a crossplatform,
</I>&gt;<i>gui agnostic (as it already is in chalks), concurrent edition library,
</I>&gt;<i>that integrate both the concurrent edition algorithm and network
</I>&gt;<i>layer.
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Sure that can be a long term goal, but a) not everyone working on 
collaborative editing will use it and b) this makes the choice 
programming language very important.

&gt;<i>Defining such library is not difficult at all (I can say it is already
</I>&gt;<i>done). 
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Twice by the sounds of it :)

&gt;<i>The only point we have to solve is the &quot;binary compatibility&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>I'm not an expert in the topic, Ricardo any knowledge/opinion on the
</I>&gt;<i>topic ? Corba, Dcop, DBus have something to do with this ? Can we do
</I>&gt;<i>binaries libraries from .Net ? Does Kde4.0 includes .Net support ?
</I>&gt;<i>(because windows has it already for longhorn and gnome defacto too).
</I>&gt;<i>It is sane to think in implement concurrent edition algorithm in
</I>&gt;<i>languages like C or C++  ? (I really do not think so)
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>I don't think C or C++ are a problem at all (having just done it myself 
in C++). But I think in order for it to be an all-plattform library 
which gets used by people of all camps it would need to be written in C 
with language bindings for C++, C#, Python, you-name-it .... Not 
something that will it happen overnight.

&gt;<i>Topics to discuss, fun on the path ! 
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Lots of fun :)

By the way do you use unit tests or how do you check validity of code?
