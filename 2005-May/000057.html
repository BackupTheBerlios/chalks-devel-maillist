<PRE>* Choose the build system
	- nAnt: brings Ant, a standard on the Java world to .NET
	- Traditional Makefile
	- A-A-P (<A HREF="http://www.a-a-p.org/">http://www.a-a-p.org/</A>): Traditional Makefile on steroids


After my first experience with Nant, I'm not very happy with it. I do
not take anymore as the first choice (but you can take a look at
<A HREF="http://svn.berlios.de/viewcvs/chalks/trunk/src/chalks.build?rev=112">http://svn.berlios.de/viewcvs/chalks/trunk/src/chalks.build?rev=112</A>
).

Traditional makefiles are a not-so-bad choice but we have to learn how
to &quot;detect&quot; the compiling platform. Others projects know how to do it
(so guy in #mono said me to take a look at gtk-sharp svn, but I did
not see anything).

I add to the list Scons
<A HREF="http://www.scons.org/">http://www.scons.org/</A>

seems to be as good as aap or better. Python dependencies are not pain
because they are only for developers and python is aviable in all the
modern unix distros anyway.

We should have to choose what makes less pain. I do not have time to
play with that things now.



* Choose the distribution system
	- Nullsoft installer for Windows system: GPL and easy to use.
	- Let's keep a dist-&lt;platform&gt; file for each one. I'm cheking in the
-win one which
	  builds a .exe binary installer/uninstaller. 
	- For nix platforms, I believe we just need to build a tar.gz archive
with full sources
	  (that could be a nAnt &quot;src&quot; target). After some time maintainers
from *nix distributions
	  may create binary packages for us adhering to their proper standards.

I agree with the general approach. I would add a compiled compressed
.Net version for linux (that would have dll dependencies) and a zipped
full dlls included version for windows, to have an &quot;unzip and run&quot;
deployment for people who do not like to install software just to test
it.
