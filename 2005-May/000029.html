<PRE>Hi,
it's great that you entered in contact. As you could notice
(<A HREF="http://chalks.berlios.de/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=dev:design">http://chalks.berlios.de/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=dev:design</A>) we had
already noticed your project but were not so sure about his status.

&gt;<i> Am I correct in assuming that your project aims to be a gnome version of
</I>&gt;<i> a concurrent editing widget, which can be used by all gnome applications
</I>&gt;<i> that chose to use/activate it?
</I>
Back in 2003 the project was the first open source concurrent edition
system (called LeoN) however it was not adapted for mass use
(developed a plug-in for a weird text editor (Leo)).
<A HREF="http://ryalias.freezope.org/souvenirs/leon">http://ryalias.freezope.org/souvenirs/leon</A>

Thus in 2004 I started Chalks, a spin out of LeoN, more adapted for
mass use. However that year this project became lower priority and go
frozen. At that time I thought 'someone else will do it anyway...'.
During the second semester of 2004 Ricardo motivated me to continue
the project and the project advanced considerably. The motto of Chalks
is &quot;collaborative text editing for everyone&quot; and that was what we
tried to do.

Both Ricardo and me had busy times at the end of 2004, so we made a
pause. At the end of the pause I realized that the code had became
spaghetti. The basics were correct but the shift between LeoN to
Chalks needed more than just some children classes.

So at the beginning 2005 I revised the design and started a full
rewrite. The motto is the same, the objective is the same, the
approach is the same, the developers are the same, the core algorithm
is the same, and the network layer design is the same. What has
changed is: a cleaner macroscopic design, a full rewrite of the code,
and the most essential, I decided to change the technology.

Up to now we developed in Python using TwistedMatrix. It was great for
developing but had three problems:
- Hard to release in a clean way
- Hard to integrate with existing platform
- Propensity to spaghetti code.

The new platform was choose because :
- It enforce clean design and code (strong typing, interfaces)
- Have excellent integration capabilities
- It can be released without too much pain

Notice that Chalks, in difference from MateEdit has a requirement to
be multiplatform: windows, linux and mac os at least.

So the chosen platform is the .Net technology (actually developing
with Mono and Nemerle) and the Gtk toolkit for the Gui.

In the last weeks the new design was implemented and now we are just
starting the debugging phase.

&gt;<i> If this is the case I propose defining network handshakes and messages
</I>&gt;<i> so that both our projects can talk to each other and thus enable GNOME
</I>&gt;<i> and KDE to integrate nicely.
</I>
Now, on the technical aspect I agree that it would be great to have
KDE/Gnome integration. Also I think it is good that open source
developer with similar/identical objectives collaborate between them.

In particular I was surprised to see how similar is your Gui approach to ours.
However I do not think that integration at network level is the correct choice.

The actual design (and implementation) of Chalks (that I have to
finish to describe on the wiki) define four distinctive layers:

Gui
ConcurrentEditableWidget
ConcurrentEditable
Network

as you are in the topic, it is obvious what each layer does. You can
also take a look at
<A HREF="http://svn.berlios.de/viewcvs/*checkout*/chalks/trunk/doc/schemas/chalks.dia">http://svn.berlios.de/viewcvs/*checkout*/chalks/trunk/doc/schemas/chalks.dia</A>
for more details.

The relation between the layers is as thin as possible and as well
defined as possible.

</PRE>
