<PRE>Hi,
still working on purification of Chalks.
I have implemented the &quot;set password&quot; interface and found that there
is a UI design issue. Up to now Kesava has not pronounced itself, so
we will have to solve the issue using your criteria.

The problem is what to do when chalks start with respect to authentication.
Actually when Chalks starts a dialog appears to request a password to
secure the actual document. If the users choice the &quot;use as default&quot;
checkbutton future instances of Chalks will use a default password,
that can be then changed using the menu &quot;File-&gt;Set password&quot;.

The problem is that when the user does not choice the &quot;use a default
password&quot; option there is a &quot;popup dialog&quot; at each execution of
Chalks, even when the user pretends to connect to another node, in
which case setting up a password for his local document is futile.

The objective is to make the software easy to use having the less
number of clicks to get a working session.

So I see three options:
1- Let it as it now, not too bad. Most users will use a blank default
password, paranoiacs will pay they price adding one dialog at each
instance.

2- Use the MoonEdit approach. At the start of a Chalks session the
document is not shared until the user explicitly click &quot;file-&gt;host&quot;.
That event would trigger the password setting.  The user can also
choice the &quot;file-&gt;join&quot; option to connect to a remote document

3 - At the start of Chalks a popup appears to force the user to choice
Host or Join. This reduce one click because it does not have to go to
the &quot;file-&gt;&quot; menu. The user could also close the dialog and the
document would be blank and not shared (as option 2).

What do you think Ricardo ?
Personally I'm more for option3, but I'm not convinced about which is
the best choice. There are also other possibilities (eg: only ask the
password when the first user connects to him) but none seems very
intuitive or efficient.

Also, should we give a visual feedback about the status of the
document (hosting, joined, non connected), how ? (does knowing the
number of users is enough/correct/useful ?)
