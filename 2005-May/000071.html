The users list should be a popup, an add/quit division or a resizable
division (like the log section but vertical)  ?
(I choose the last one) 

&gt;<i> A good feature would be allowing users to edit a text near their entry
</I>&gt;<i> on this user list, describing what they are currently working on or
</I>&gt;<i> thinking about. So they don't need to explain what they are doing on

</I>&gt;<i> find out what user X was thinking about and what he is trying to edit
</I>&gt;<i> on the shared text file.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This feature would also be a flexible and simple substitute to &quot;away&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> features. So you can change your &quot;user list&quot; extra description from
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;reviewing specification section&quot; to something like &quot;away for 5min.&quot;.
</I>
This feature is trivially implementable. Simply we parse the received messages.
Messages starting as &quot;/setstatus blabla&quot; are interpreted as special
messages. Then we just need to add a simple interface  for non
poweruser, that interface would then generate a message with the good
format.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Essentially I have two questions whose answer is not clear to me:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; A) Which things should we let the user configure ?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; B) How we should associate the colors in the text to the users ?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; My answer for question A) is : &quot;Nothing&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Ultra simple programs does not need preferences.  If user lack of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; something, we should make it autoconfigured.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I agree with your minimalistic approach to make the software easier to
</I>&gt;<i> use and more robust, but I believe there are some important options
</I>&gt;<i> that can't be autoconfigured, including:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1) Edit widget font size: some people need larger fonts and some like
</I>&gt;<i> a lot of text viewable at once, etc.
</I>&gt;<i> 2) Choosing whether or not the editor should replace Tabs with spaces

</I>&gt;<i> editor, so our target users are those who want to work with pure text
</I>&gt;<i> files, and for some of them these aspects are important.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Question B) is more difficult, I see three options:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a) Coloring consistently the messages received is enough
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; b) The user type the command \who to get an up-to-date list of the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; users, each name colored consistently
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I suggest using &quot;/who&quot; instead of '\who', that is, with a
</I>&gt;<i> forward-slash, to be consistent with IRC commands. But I believe these
</I>&gt;<i> /xyz commands are only intended for power-users, so for every  /xyz
</I>&gt;<i> command, there should be a menu or toolbar option.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> These commands would also be very useful for us during debugging.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; c) There is always a section of the window that show a colored users
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; list (this one I want to avoid it, knowing users colors is a not
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; highly relevant for the user, however is the way Subethadedit and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; MoonEdit does it)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yeah, I also agree we could leave that to a second release, but it
</I>&gt;<i> would be fine to make this &quot;user list&quot; richer in terms of information.

</I>&gt;<i> &quot;reviewing specification section&quot; to something like &quot;away for 5min.&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; d) When putting the mouse over colored text a popup appears to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; indicate the originator name's
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I guess this is not needed. In most cases, there will be an average of
</I>&gt;<i> only 2 concurrent editors, so a simple panel somewhere on the GUI or
</I>&gt;<i> as a menu showing which color is which user is fine. The user will
</I>&gt;<i> verify it 3 times and after that he will memorize.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; e) The user click over the &quot;N users&quot; section of the status bar and a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; secondary window appears with the list of the users. The user can
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; switch from one window to the other to consult the users.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Even though bringing user info after clicking on this status bar label
</I>&gt;<i> seems logical, it may not seem intuitive. I believe we should let the
</I>&gt;<i> user list on a very visible place, because people need to constantly
</I>&gt;<i> know who's online or not.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Summarizing my opinion:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> a) + b) + c)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In this order of implementation.
