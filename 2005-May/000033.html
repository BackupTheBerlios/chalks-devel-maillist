<PRE>I did not explained why I do not think it is technically sound to
integrate at network level: the core reason I'm thinking about is
simply because it depends on the algorithm implemented. And if it
depends on the algorithm, then it does not make sense to replicate
they implementation, being double bug prone.

In contrast the relation between the network+concurrenteditable with
the concurrenteditionwidget+gui is algorithm independent.

To me it make more sense to develop a &quot;concurrent edition library&quot;
that different applications could use. Then we can discuss which
algorithm use and which language implementation.

Focusing on network layer will constrain too much future algorithm, or
will require to define a too ample network protocol that will dificult
to implement anyway (too much, what if cases).

Actually I think that .Net platform is essentially Gui agnostic.
However we can think in a language agnostic module interconnection
system to ease the integration with even larger range of applications.

To enforce the point about the algorithm and the network protocol.
Supose that I'm implementing an algorithm without garbage collection
(as MoonEdit probably does) then the data to start a session would be:
state vector, history buffer, text, delayed_operations. If I implement
garbage collection, then additional information is required,
minimum_state_vector and state_vector_table. Thus two implementation
would anyway be incompatible. Of course we are already enforcing one
kind of history buffer (linear in Chalks case) and the data encoded
into the operations is also algorithm specific (definition of the
state_vector, members for the special cases (relative adressing,
splitted operations, lost information)). So this simple example
reforce the concept, trying to define a protocol between different
algorithms is almost impossible. If we are going to fix the algorithm
to fix the network protocol, then we are loosing flexibility and
evolvability for both the network layer and the concurrent edition
layer (that would lead to the apparition of non compatible
applications anyway). The logic choice is to define a crossplatform,
gui agnostic (as it already is in chalks), concurrent edition library,
that integrate both the concurrent edition algorithm and network
layer.

Defining such library is not difficult at all (I can say it is already
done). The only point we have to solve is the &quot;binary compatibility&quot;.
I'm not an expert in the topic, Ricardo any knowledge/opinion on the
topic ? Corba, Dcop, DBus have something to do with this ? Can we do
binaries libraries from .Net ? Does Kde4.0 includes .Net support ?
(because windows has it already for longhorn and gnome defacto too).
It is sane to think in implement concurrent edition algorithm in
languages like C or C++  ? (I really do not think so)

Topics to discuss, fun on the path !

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> That was my initial idea as well. But then I realised that integrating

</I>&gt;<i> applications (KDevelop, Quanta Plus, Kile, PiKdev, KScope, Krusader) to
</I>&gt;<i> immediately use that technology. This integration is currently scheduled
</I>&gt;<i> for KDE 4.0.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;If this is the case I propose defining network handshakes and messages
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;so that both our projects can talk to each other and thus enable GNOME
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;and KDE to integrate nicely.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;I think collaboration for integration is great topic, however I do not
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;think it is technically factible or desirable to define an integration
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;at the network level.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> I believe that defining the network layer is the easiest part. It would

</I>&gt;<i> WxWindows or whatever) to use a widget that was written with toolkit Y
</I>&gt;<i> and/or a different programming language.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;In our actual design and implementation it is very very easy to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;implement a KDE frontend on the top of the underlying layers.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;I invit you to share ideas, create sinergy and evaluate the idea of

</I>&gt;<i> another editor&quot; which can only do one thing better than the rest will be
</I>&gt;<i> ignored by the users. Sure they'll use it every-so-often, but if they
</I>&gt;<i> can't share collaboration sessions with people using other editors they
</I>&gt;<i> will quickly get upset and we'll have fragmentation, because not
</I>&gt;<i> everyone will switch.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> All I am asking right now is to define a simple set of messages that
</I>&gt;<i> each editor will understand (Insert, Delete, Chat, Joining, User data
</I>&gt;<i> and maybe a couple of others) so people have a choice in what editor to
