If your application is server based, you should look at the method

chalks/chalks0/src/ConcurrentEdition.py:TestConcurrentEditionServer

in the svn repository, there is a test case for a server-N clients architecture.

Of course, we are not trying to create a development platform for
everyone, just an application for everyone.

</I>
Howhever what do you think about creating a base library ? Or about
defining an implementation independent interface such that different
implementations could be exchangable under the same gui ? (I mean
creating a hard separation between gui and collaboration service).

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;Convergence is an issue because the users generate different

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;what you describe. Two operations at the same point at the same

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe I didn't describe it clear enough. Assume Person A types ABC and

</I>&gt;<i> being an issue in this case I meant that the intentation preservation
</I>&gt;<i> solves the problem of convergence automatically for all other cases.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;I agree that centralized approaches are much simpler, however we did
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;not wanted to use this approach for two reasons:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;- this approach overload the bandwidth of the &quot;server&quot; node.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;- if two groups are collaborating, all the delay will be as slow as
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;the server node. In decentralized approach nodes in local area
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;networks have the delay of local area network and nodes in remote
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;locations have the delay of remote locations. I expect that this
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;effect will be noticeable.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;- a decentralized approach allow to use one and only one node as &quot;server&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> OK
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;Fair enough, but again it just might not get used by people using
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;different languages. (kde libs are usually C++ based for example)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;the dotnet platform can interest people programming in ML, Java, C#,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;Python, we consider that .Net allow better integration and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;collaboration between &quot;people of different languages&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;Personally I'm language agnostic, I just try to use the correct tool
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;available for the required job.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;The topic is deployability and compatibility, not a C# versus C++ flame ware.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> This is all fine by me. I don't even want to tell you what tools to use.
</I>&gt;<i> All I'm trying to say is that I don't believe everyone else will take it
</I>&gt;<i> like that.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;Finally,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;let's imagine that we have a common protocol. And now imagine that I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;need to change something, for example, sites identifier are no more 16
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;bytes random numbers, but Ip+Port strings.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;Doing such change would not break immediately the compatibility ?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> Sure changing from a number to a string will be a problem.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;What would have to be done to have systems inter operate again ?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> We would have to define a new version of the networking protocol
</I>&gt;<i> (protocol version should be checked in the initial connection anyway)
</I>&gt;<i> and maybe try and set up a work around for old clients.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;It will be hard to me to think that specifying a protocol is not
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;create double work, double bugs and double pain.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> I think we are already doing exactly doing that by using 2 different
</I>&gt;<i> approaches.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> After looking at your test cases I think the whole thing could be
