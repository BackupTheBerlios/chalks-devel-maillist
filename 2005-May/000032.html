</I>Ok, I will just reply to this one :)

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>Am I correct in assuming that your project aims to be a gnome version of

</I>&gt;<i>No, we want to develop an application that is simple for the end user.
</I>&gt;<i>In the actual rewrite we use technologies that allow very easy
</I>&gt;<i>integration in other applications, but it is not us purpose.
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>That was my initial idea as well. But then I realised that integrating 
MateEdit into KDE or more specifically Kate would enable a whole heap of 
applications (KDevelop, Quanta Plus, Kile, PiKdev, KScope, Krusader) to 
immediately use that technology. This integration is currently scheduled 
for KDE 4.0.

&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>If this is the case I propose defining network handshakes and messages
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>so that both our projects can talk to each other and thus enable GNOME
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>and KDE to integrate nicely.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I think collaboration for integration is great topic, however I do not
</I>&gt;<i>think it is technically factible or desirable to define an integration
</I>&gt;<i>at the network level.
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>I believe that defining the network layer is the easiest part. It would 
be a lot harder to convince someone using toolkit X (be it GTK, Qt/KDE, 
WxWindows or whatever) to use a widget that was written with toolkit Y 
and/or a different programming language.

&gt;<i>In our actual design and implementation it is very very easy to
</I>&gt;<i>implement a KDE frontend on the top of the underlying layers.
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
&gt;<i>I invit you to share ideas, create sinergy and evaluate the idea of
</I>&gt;<i>developing such Kde frontend.
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Sharing ideas is really what I'm after :) The problem I have though is 
that if we don't agree on a network protocol, we will just be creating 
islands of collaboration. At the moment I believe that creating &quot;yet 
another editor&quot; which can only do one thing better than the rest will be 
ignored by the users. Sure they'll use it every-so-often, but if they 
can't share collaboration sessions with people using other editors they 
will quickly get upset and we'll have fragmentation, because not 
everyone will switch.

All I am asking right now is to define a simple set of messages that 
each editor will understand (Insert, Delete, Chat, Joining, User data 
and maybe a couple of others) so people have a choice in what editor to 
use. I believe that is the easiest way to start and we can continue from 
there.
