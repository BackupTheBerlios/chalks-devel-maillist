</I>
Messages is the easiest part of the problem. What happens with binary
formats?  Encryption ? Site identifiers ? States are vectors or Hash ?
In Chalks we do not have &quot;a server&quot; ?

I do not think we should focus on detail, but on basic concept. Let's
fix some points:

Do we agree that fixing a protocol necessarily imply fixing a specific
algorithm ?



&gt;<i> &gt;Actually I think that .Net platform is essentially Gui agnostic.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;However we can think in a language agnostic module interconnection
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;system to ease the integration with even larger range of applications.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> Just as you already found out not everyone likes .Net or even Mono. The
</I>&gt;<i> danger of the whole thing being shut down, due to some dubious patent or
</I>&gt;<i> license is just to big for some people.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
Exactly as some persons tried to enforce patents over linux, over
double click, over kind of web pages, etc... License is something we
have to deal with.

Chalks developed is driven over objectives. Up to know .Net platforms
seems to have been the best choice.

&gt;<i> &gt;To enforce the point about the algorithm and the network protocol.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;Supose that I'm implementing an algorithm without garbage collection
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;(as MoonEdit probably does)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> You probably meant MateEdit ;)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; then the data to start a session would be:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;state vector, history buffer, text, delayed_operations. If I implement
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;garbage collection, then additional information is required,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;minimum_state_vector and state_vector_table. Thus two implementation
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;would anyway be incompatible. Of course we are already enforcing one
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;kind of history buffer (linear in Chalks case) and the data encoded
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;into the operations is also algorithm specific (definition of the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;state_vector, members for the special cases (relative adressing,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;splitted operations, lost information)). So this simple example
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;reforce the concept, trying to define a protocol between different
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;algorithms is almost impossible.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> I am not at all familiar with where the problems are with the &quot;garbage
</I>&gt;<i> collection&quot; algorithm you mention.
</I>&gt;<i> In my mind what is needed to start a session is the text and optionally
</I>&gt;<i> a description for each character so a colour and other information can
</I>&gt;<i> be associated. Then you add user data and if you are really keen you can
</I>&gt;<i> retransmit every message that was sent so far to create a history
</I>&gt;<i> buffer, in which case you don't need the text nor the extra character
</I>&gt;<i> information.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;If we are going to fix the algorithm
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;to fix the network protocol, then we are loosing flexibility and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;evolvability for both the network layer and the concurrent edition
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;layer (that would lead to the apparition of non compatible
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;applications anyway). The logic choice is to define a crossplatform,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;gui agnostic (as it already is in chalks), concurrent edition library,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;that integrate both the concurrent edition algorithm and network
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;layer.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> Sure that can be a long term goal, but a) not everyone working on
</I>&gt;<i> collaborative editing will use it and b) this makes the choice
</I>&gt;<i> programming language very important.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
We are not talking about long term goals, we talk about what is
necessary to achieve the interoperability / smooth integration goal.

&gt;<i> &gt;Defining such library is not difficult at all (I can say it is already
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;done).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> Twice by the sounds of it :)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
Could you show us you design ? Or comment the diagrams sent ? Do we
agree on the overall form ?

&gt;<i> &gt;The only point we have to solve is the &quot;binary compatibility&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;I'm not an expert in the topic, Ricardo any knowledge/opinion on the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;topic ? Corba, Dcop, DBus have something to do with this ? Can we do
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;binaries libraries from .Net ? Does Kde4.0 includes .Net support ?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;(because windows has it already for longhorn and gnome defacto too).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;It is sane to think in implement concurrent edition algorithm in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;languages like C or C++  ? (I really do not think so)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> I don't think C or C++ are a problem at all (having just done it myself
</I>&gt;<i> in C++). But I think in order for it to be an all-plattform library
</I>&gt;<i> which gets used by people of all camps it would need to be written in C
</I>&gt;<i> with language bindings for C++, C#, Python, you-name-it .... Not
</I>&gt;<i> something that will it happen overnight.
</I>&gt;<i>
