<PRE>Well I'm pretty happy the design cleanup and full rewrite of Chalks
seems to have been a complete success !

Actually I can say that we have reached the same features available in
the previous alpha version, but this time code is much cleaner and
structure still being visible. I'm confident that this time we got it
right. We already had a first successful dummy test session and a
windows compilation/buggy execution.

It miss some elements before we get to beta. I'm writing this mail
because I think I should be fine to make the point on what is working,
what is not working and what are the priorities. Here is the list of
things to do (in no special order),

a - The concurrentedition has been translated and pass the base test.
That is good enough for alpha but more  tests have to be write (clever
ones, that search tricky situations)

b - The network layer has been implemented in his first version. It is
condemned to evolve to a more efficient use of bandwidth, but the
remoting implementation is good enough for a proof of concept.
Actually the network pass all his tests. All the type of messages are
tested. Maybe some tests at start_collaborating level could be written
(test authorization, authorization denial ?), but seems to be low
priority (unless we discover that this area is bug prone...).

c - ConcurrentEditableWidget is implemented and work pretty fine. The
only feature I would like to add is tooltip over colored text to show
&quot;who wrote that&quot;.

d- The Gui is implemented but the interface and interactions design
should be validated/corrected by an usability consultor.

e - For beta it would be fine to implement undo/redo (commonly used by
persons).

f - There is a minibug not yet resolved about the behaviour of the gui
when the user press &quot;up arrow&quot; at the command entry. This button
should go up in the commands history (implemented), but actually it
also make loose the focus of the widget (focus go to the upper widget,
the logs text).

g - The preferences dialog is not implemented because I have nothing
to put in. Hopefully there is no need to have one ;).

h - The connection dialog is not yet ZeroConf enabled.

i - Actually Chalks start immediately sharing the document.  This
behaviour has be chosen because Chalks is made for collaborating, if
the user open it is because that document will be shared. A menu have
to be added to set the password and probably an icon to show that the
document access is protected by password (stock_lock , stock_lock_open
) or not (a click on the lock should allow the parent node to change
the password for future connections). In this way by default the
document is open, it can be protected before sensitive information is
added for private documents. When opening a file, the password should
be asked after the file is open but before the file is shared (to
avoid, just in time attacks ?).

j - We do not know how to make the &quot;makefile&quot; crossplatform. We would
like also to extend it to automagically build the distribution
packages (nis and source tar.gz). Maybe we should choose another, more
powerful compilation system.

k - the documentation have to be finished (wiki and help dialogs of
the application)

l - some cool swf videos have to be registered to, explain the usage of chalks

m - quit in the application does not quit (long standing unacceptable
bug) (only the second attempt close the application)

n - sourceview has to be reinserted in the compilation. Makes more
complicated the compilation, but enable syntax coloring and line
numbers. A very important feature for many people (specially for us
early adopters group)

o - we should contact a Gtk#/Cocoa# community to ask a Mac
collaborator, to help with compatibility of Chalks on Mac and/or the
development of a Cocoa gui for Chalks.

The list is not short, but anyway I will try to order it from higher
priority to less urgency:

1  - The quit bug 
2  - The &quot;arrow up&quot; command entry bug
3  - The crossplatform compilation system enhancement
4  - ZeroConf support
5  - Interface and interactions design validation
6  - Preferences dialog (what we want to make customizable)
7  - Undo/Redo implementation
8  - Implement password user interface
9  - Application and wiki documentation
10- ConcurrentEditableWidget tooltips
11- SourceView usage
12- More automated tests for concurrentedition
13- More automated tests for network layer
14- MacOs support
15- Promotional videos

This is a proposal, a suggestion. I just thougth that writing it would
make easier to see where we are and what have to be done. Also it
would help to see if I'm forgetting something. I'm forgetting
something ? Does the priorities does not seems adequate ?
