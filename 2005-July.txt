Subject: [Chalks-devel] realtime web-based concurrent editing
Message-ID: <35f9d9da05070821282b783367@mail.gmail.com>

I just came across this post at 
http://fettig.net/weblog/2005/07/08/jotspot-live/

I requested a trial account. I really want to see all the javascript
magic necessary to make such a thing only using browsers as clients.

Using browsers as clients makes things easy on the client side (no
need to download anything) but has the downside of requiring a
dedicated web server.

but ricardo, look at 
http://jot.com/images/blog/hackathon/Live%20Editing/Movie%20of%20Live%20Editing.html

they do paragraphs blocking !
that is extremely easy to do, in one week with
javascript+python+twisted such kind of thing is done.

to have realtime concurrent text edition from only a browser it would
be necessary to port the gui in javascript (not really trivial) AND
the concurrent edition module (to manage operations received while the
user is writing in the interface).  The network layer would be the RPC
mechanism used in AJAX, and a star network configuration (everyone
connected to the server).

Maybe in the short future it will be possible to code client side Web
applications in .Net (with restrictions for users security)? (as a
patch solution existed for Python in the past...)

As now the principal task for Chalks is debugging and polishing I
created the bug tracker in the berlios tracker

http://developer.berlios.de/bugs/?group_id=2147

Let's enjoy the bug documenting and solving !

Hi Ricardo,

As a Gnome user myself I'm very excited about Chalks. Can't wait to use
it! JotSpot Live is focused specifically on the task of editing XHTML,
not text, so it takes a slightly different approach. I'd love to hear
what you think of the work we've done so far. Also if you haven't had a
chance to use JotSpot Live with another user yet, let me know; I can
meet you on one of the pages so you can see how our edits get synchronized.

Abe

We're both working on the Chalks project (http://chalks.berlios.de), which aims to be a cross platform realtime concurrent text editing software. It'd be interesting to see how this problem can be solved with a web-only approach.
