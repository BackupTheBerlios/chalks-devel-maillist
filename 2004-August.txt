In the sake of simplicity I had omited that possibility, implementing in 
exchange a "who" command for in "advanced chat usage". I think writing 
"help" in the chat bar should print out the implemented commands.

I agree, Tkinter is ugly, but simple. Definitelly GUI code has to be 
separated from the rest to allow futures gui changes.

That is what I tried to say writing "spread it to  all the Other known 
sites"

Cool, name ? url ?  msn ? (asktav did not get google results)

I'm happy now to have written all the text in the wiki, adding some 
screenshots, to get easier to catch the ideas.

I will try to get some time in between here to december (asap) to solve 
dummy issues in the code. (as for example the actual error in the 
conection).

I would like we agree in the desired behaviour when someone disconnect 
himself (in the topology topic), this is the only point missing to get a 
smooth cool global design.

rodrigob.
